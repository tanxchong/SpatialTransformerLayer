# Implementation for Spatial Transformer Network for Caffe

This code implemented the hot-off-the-press paper [Spatial Transformer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025) in one of the most popular deep learning frameworks -- [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).

The code contains both implementation for Spatial Transformer Layer (named with `st_layer`) and a regularizer on the magnitude of spatial transformations (named with `st_loss_layer`). The latter one is useful for adjusting how aggressive would you like your spatial transformer layer to perform.

## Organization of the Code

* **src/caffe/layers:** contains the GPU implementation (`.cpp` and `.cu` file) for Spatial Transformer Layer. Notice that CPU version is not refined and it will be mush faster to use GPU version. Since I did not test on CPU version too much, it may not even correct.
* **src/caffe/proto:** contains my proto definition for Spatial Transformer Layer (Search for 'SpatialTransformerParameter').
* **src/caffe/test:** containts a test file for Spatial Transformer Layer.
* **include:** contains the `.hpp` file for the layer.
* **examples:** contains several sample setting files (`.prototxt` files) for its usages on MNIST digits and CUB bird datasets. They should be useful in understanding how to use my Spatial Transformer layer. Notice that they may not be trainable on your local machines because I have another customized layers added to my version of caffe.

## Usage of Layer

* My layer only support affine transformation with six parameters received from the above layer as follows.
	
        T = [	\theta_11 \theta_12 \theta_13;
				\theta_21 \theta_22 \theta_23
			]
	
* It is not necessary that the above layer generates exactly six parameters. If it generates two (e.g. `\theta\_13` and `\theta\_23`, this is the case for only allowing translation to happen), you can indicate other four parameters in parameters for this Spatial Transformer Layer as follows.
	
          layer {
            name: "st_1"
            type: "SpatialTransformer"
            bottom: "data"
            bottom: "st/theta_1"
            top: "inc1/data"
            st_param {
              to_compute_dU: false
              output_H: 224
              output_W: 224
              theta_1_1: 0.5
              theta_1_2: 0
              theta_2_1: 0
              theta_2_2: 0.5
            }
          }
	
* In the above example, `output\_H` and `output\_W` is for indicating the output resolution, which can be differed from the resolution of input images.
* Image sizes of both input and ouput images range from [-1,1]. Hence, -1< alpha\*x+ beta <1 when x is in (-1 1). Thus, when x alpha = 0.25, Loc\_Loss\_Layer param is set to 0.75
* It is usually the case that Spatial Transformer Layer will be applied directly on input images to the networks. If this is the case, there is no need to backpropogate the loss to image pixels. One can set `to_compute_dU: false` in order to disable this useless backpropogation. The default value is `True`.
* One may find it extremely useful to refer to caffe.proto to see my definition for layer parameters of Spatial Transformer Layer.


## Other Helper Layers or Utils

* FileFiller can be found in ./include/caffe/file\_filler.hpp. It can read initial filler values for parameters from files.
* Loc\_Loss\_Layer can be found in ./src/caffe/layers and ./include/caffe/. It is designed by me when I experimented on CUB dataset and struggled with the problem that the transformations are so severe that the current focus is outside the region of the pixel space. If this is the case, there is no way that the focus can come back since there is no loss for it. This layer directly force parts of thetas to be small. Note that this layer works in the way that it will force any input values to be smaller than a threshold, so it will only force the parts of thetas that are computed from the bottom layer.
* ST\_Loss\_Layer can be found in ./src/caffe/layers and ./include/caffe/. Similar to Loc\_Loss\_Layer, it is also designed for forcing the focus of ST layer to be inside the pixel space. The only difference is that it forces the transformed grids instead of the theta values. 
* Power\_File\_Layer can be found in ./src/caffe/layers and ./include/caffe/. It works in the similar way as Caffe Power\_Layer. The only difference is that the shift values can be different for each values in the data blob. Since I only need shift functionality in my project, there is no implementation for scale and power functionalities. These two are easy to implement if one needs it.
